# DD2480_CI
Continuous Integration Assignment in the KTH course DD2480.

## Commit convention
All commits should be performed on the appropriate issue branch

Prefixes: ```feat/, fix/, docs/, refactor/, test/```

New since last project: use ```test/``` instead of ```feat/``` when adding tests, based on feedback from TA. Additionally, use ```docs/``` instead of ```doc/``` (notice the s).

# Essence analysis (Team)
Using the essence standard, the team is currently in the state of “Collaborating”, and is making great progress towards "Performing". All necessary bits to get the mission done have been listed and communication through our selected channels are becoming second nature. Everyone is pulling in the same direction and are acting for a good result and atmosphere in the group. In the first assignment, the work consisted of more but smaller sub-tasks, which made it easy to divide and share the workload. For the second assignment, however, fewer but more complex tasks were identified. The team handled this flawlessly by pairing up and forming smaller groups, while simultaneously using the team member's individual strengths to get the job done. 

In the performing state we do not consider the following to be satisfied “Wasted work and the potential for wasted work are continuously identified and eliminated”. In our regular follow-up meetings, our progress is reported, and potential issues are discussed, so that we can tackle problems proactively. However, no real attempts have been made to identify “wasted work” as the main focus has been on solving the problems at hand. If we could incorporate some sort of reflection on the finished work in our meetings, we could achieve the criteria of avoiding backtracking and eliminating wasted work (and move on to the next state). Additionally, there has been a small amount of reworking that perhaps could be avoided if we had planned a bit better beforehand. Since we are fulfilling our planned goals, assign and adept the group work structure according to the phase of the assignment we are in, as well as progress without external help,  we consider those parts of "Performing" to be fulfilled. By reflecting on finished work, and paying attention to avoiding potential reworking we can progress to the "Performing" stage.
