# DD2480_CI
Continuous Integration Assignment in the KTH course DD2480.

## Commit convention
All commits should be performed on the appropriate issue branch

Prefixes: ```feat/, fix/, docs/, refactor/, test/```

New since last project: use ```test/``` instead of ```feat/``` when adding tests, based on feedback from TA. Additionally, use ```docs/``` instead of ```doc/``` (notice the s).
