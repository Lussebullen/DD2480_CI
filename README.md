# DD2480_CI
Continuous Integration Assignment in the KTH course DD2480.

## Commit convention
All commits should be performed on the appropriate issue branch

Prefixes: ```feat/, fix/, doc/, refactor/, test/```

New since last project: use ```test/``` instead of ```feat/``` when adding tests, based on feedback from TA.
